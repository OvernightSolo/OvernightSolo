- 👋 Hi, I’m @OvernightSolo, otherwise known as Robert Sterling, or Scott.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a coding ninja, playing chamber music on cello, and being less of a cynic.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning French and full stack web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... well, anything in order to get my chops up.
- 📫 How to reach me ... sterlingtx75@gmail.com, LinkedIn, and you can ask me for my number.
